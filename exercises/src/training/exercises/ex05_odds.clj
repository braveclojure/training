;; Write a function (and any helper functions) that calculates the
;; odds of a sum being returned when two n-sided dice are thrown.
;;
;; Examples:
;; (odds 3 6 6) => 1/18
;; (odds 3 4 4) => 1/8
;;
;; In both these examples, 3 is the sum. The other two numbers are the
;; number of sides the dice have.
;;
;; It's definitely doable using just the functions and operators that
;; you've seen so far. Have fun :)
